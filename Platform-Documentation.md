## 1. INTRODUCTION
This document describes the objectives and explicit functional requirements of MOSIP. It also gives an overview of architecturally significant features, APIs and standards followed in MOSIP. Lastly, it provides necessary information on implementation, customization and set up.

## 2. FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW[**[↑]**](#table-of-contents)
This section gives a functional overview of the platform, driven by the key functional modules listed below. Further details are available on each modules under [Requirement Specifications](#4-requirement-specifications) 
### 2.1 Pre-Registration

Pre-registration is the web channel of the MOSIP. This module enables a user to:  
1. Book an appointment for registration 
1. Enter demographic data & upload supporting documents 
1. Appointment notification, rescheduling and cancellation 
1. Send resident data to registration center before appointment, which can be used during registration 

[Detailed functional specifications of pre-registration module](FRS-Pre-Registration) 

### 2.2 Registration Services
Registration Client application captures the demographic and biometric details of an individual along with supporting information (proof documents & information about parent/guardian/introducer) and packages the information in a secure way. This module provides the following capabilities:
1. Provides a secure way of capturing an individual's demographic and biometric data
1. Provides interfaces to biometric devices that comply to industry standards
1. Works in online and offline mode to capture data
1. Provides option to transfer data to server when online and helps in uninterrupted registrations
1. Client has the ability to update itself for patch upgrades (bug fixes/enhancements) in a remote way. There could be hundreds of client instances running on laptops/desktops. Updates on all of them are controlled by the client and a central server.
1. Registration client is secured such that it cannot be tampered with or misused

[Detailed functional specifications of registration services](FRS-Registration-Services)


### 2.3 Registration Processor
Registration Processor processes the data (demographic and biometric) of an individual for quality and uniqueness and then issues a Unique Identification Number (UIN). The source of data are primarily from:
1. MOSIP Registration Client
1. Existing ID system(s) of a country

This module has the following capabilities:
1. Provides guaranteed packet processing - Not lose the packet once received on the server
1. Handle server failure, recovery and re-submission of packets for processing automatically
1. Add new processing step(s) without changing existing steps as different countries may have different processing requirements
1. Integrate with multiple ABIS providers. Accommodate sending one or more biometric modality to one or more ABISs and calculate a composite fusion score and then take a decision on the processing
1. Each processing step is scalable independently based on the load

[Detailed functional requirement specifications of Registration Processor](FRS-Registration-Processor)
### 2.4 ID Authentication

ID Authentication in MOSIP provides services through APIs that validates the authenticity of a resident based on one or more factors (demographic and biometric). The authentication services are integrated with TSPs (Trusted Service Providers) for delivering eKYC services to citizens via user agencies.

This module provides the following capabilities:
1. Authenticate an individual in a secure and trusted way
1. Capture the biometric data as per the defined standards
1. Authenticate an individual based on their basic identity data captured via MOSIP
1. In addition to demographic and biometric authentication, an individual can also be authenticated based on the following parameters:
   * Temporary One Time Password (TOTP) based 
   * Static pin 
   * Challenge response
5. Authentication APIs
1. High Availability (HA) to ensure smooth service
1. Scalable to cater to the growing population of a country
1. Protects an Individual's identity from request-replay attacks
1. Audited for reporting and fraud management checks

[Detailed functional requirement specifications for authentication services](FRS-Authentication-Services)

Additionally a user can also track status of his/her UIN generation after registration. 
These services include:

1. Retrieve Lost RID (registration ID).
2. Track Status of UIN Generation via RID.

[Detailed functional specifications of resident services module](FRS-Resident-Services)
### 2.8 Partner Management (WIP)

Partner Management provides services for Partner and MISP (MOSIP Infrastructure Service Provider) Registration and Authentication. Only Registered Partners and MISP are allowed to access MOSIP Authentication services. Partners and MISP are registered using Partner Management Services.  Authentication services of MOSIP will internally use the Partner Management Services to authenticate Partner and MISP and validate if only the registered entities are accessing the services.

Partner Management also involves policy management for Partners. Each partner can access authentication services only based on a defined policy. Authentication services of MOSIP will internally use the Partner Management Services to authenticate a partner based on the policy.

Partners send authentication request and receive authentication responses in a secured setup. Public/Private keys are used for encryption/decryption/signing the request/response. A few of the key management activities are managed in the Partner Management Services.

Further Certificates are used by Partners for signing the authentication request. Partner Management Services is used for a few of the signature related services.
