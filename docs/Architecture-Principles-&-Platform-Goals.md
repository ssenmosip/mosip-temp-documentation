# Architecture Principles
MOSIP is built on the following architecture principles

* MOSIP must not use proprietary or commercial license frameworks. Where deemed essential, such components must be encapsulated to enable their replacement if necessary (to avoid vendor lock-in)
* MOSIP must use open standards to expose it’s functionality (to avoid technology lock-in)
* Each MOSIP component must be independently scalable (scale out) to meet varying load requirements
* MOSIP must use commodity computing hardware & software to build the platform
* Data must be encrypted in-flight and at-rest. All requests must be authenticated and authorized. Privacy of Identity Data is an absolute must in MOSIP
* MOSIP must follow platform based approach so that all common features are abstracted as reusable components and frameworks into a common layer
* MOSIP must follow API first approach and expose the business functions as RESTful services
* MOSIP must follow the following manageability principles – Auditability & monitor ability of every event in the system, testability of every feature of the platform & easy upgrade ability of the platform
* MOSIP components must be loosely coupled so that they can be composed to build the identity solution as per the requirements of a country
* MOSIP must support i18n capability
* All modules of MOSIP should be resilient such that the solution as a whole is fault tolerant
* The key sub-systems of MOSIP should be designed for extensibility. For example, if an external system has to be integrated for fingerprint data, it should be easy to do so
