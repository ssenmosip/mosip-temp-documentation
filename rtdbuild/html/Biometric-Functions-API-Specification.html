  <p><strong>Draft 3 (August, 2019)</strong></p>
<p>MOSIP uses biometrics in the registration and the authentication processes. As part of this it requires specialized processing of the biometrics data for different types of biometrics. This document defines the interface for the Java Library providing the functional support for processing biometrics.</p>

<ul>
<li>The biometric record will have a jpeg2000 format lossless image or minutiae in an ISO template (FMR).
<li>The on record biometrics will be jpeg200 format lossless images or biometric extracts tagged to a specific extractor.
<li>Best matches are provided for an image to image match. The sample and on records data are both images. The matcher uses its own extraction algorithm on the images to be compared.
<li>In case the sample is not an image but minutiae (FMR) then the match accuracy and efficacy might be lower as the extraction templates and algorithms might not be the same
<li>In case the on record extract is a format that the matcher does not understand the match will not happen. Also if the comparison is between two extracts (Minutiae) the False Rejection and False Acceptance cases might be high
<li>A typical 1 : n match is used when comparing one finger received to a set of fingers (upto 10) on record for that person or a limited set of people (upto 10 per person).
<li>The match score will return a score specific to the library as well as a confidence score on a scale of 100.

<ul><li>Input and on record images are jpeg2000 format lossless images<li>The matcher uses its own algorithm to perform extraction, segmentation and identifying patterns on the images being compared.<li>Typical comparisons are 1 : 2 for a person and 1 : n for multiple people.

    For non fingerprint biometrics characteristics and patterns and landmarks might be identified and stored in a custom format. This format will be proprietary to each extractor and can be only consumed by its corresponding matcher. The extract will also contain meta information about the extractor and the version of the algorithm it uses and any other assumption it has made in the process of extraction that can be useful during matching.

<p>The quality score object will have two sections. One is the score section and the other is the analytics section.</p>
<p>Score Parameters</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Graded score on a scale of 100. This is an unsigned float that represents a % and can have values between 0 and 100 including decimals like 82.45.</p></li>
<li><p>Internal Score as defined on the scale of the implementing library. This is an unsigned long</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Analytics</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>List of name value pairs that can be used to convey additional information. The values filled are specific to the implementing library.
