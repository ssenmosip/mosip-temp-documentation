<h1>Partner Management<a class="headerlink" href="#partner-management" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Partner Management provides services for Partner and MISP (MOSIP Infrastructure Service Provider) Registration and Authentication. Registered Partners and MISP are only allowed to access MOSIP Authentication services. Partners and MISP are registered using Partner Management Services.  Authentication services of MOSIP will internally use the Partner Management Services to authenticate Partner and MISP and validate if only the registered entities are accessing the services.</p>
<p>Partner Management also involves policy management for Partners. Each partner can access Authentication services only based on a defined policy. Authentication services of MOSIP will internally use the Partner Management Services to authenticate a partner based on the policy.</p>
<p>Partner Management also includes License Key Management services. Authentication Services of MOSIP will utilize Partner Management services for License key based authentication of a MISP Partners send authentication request and receive authentication responses in a secured setup. Public/Private keys are used for encryption/decryption/signing the request/response. Distribution of Public key to Partners and retrieval of Public key from partners is managed by Partner Management Services.</p>
<p>Partners will utilize MOSIP’s resigned digital certificate from Partner Management Services for signing the authentication request.</p>
