<h2>1.1 Registration Officer and Supervisor on-boarding <a class="reference external" href="#table-of-contents"><strong>[â]</strong></a><a class="headerlink" href="#registration-officer-and-supervisor-on-boarding" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h2>
<p>When a registration officer or supervisor is onboarded  on an online client machine for the first time, they provide their biometric details, which will be stored and mapped to the client machine locally. This locally stored data helps to authenticate a supervisor or registration officer.</p>
<p>Registration Client enables capturing an officer's biometrics during on-boarding to support login, local duplicate checks, and registration submission.</p>
<p><strong>Map registration officers and supervisors to a client machine</strong></p>
<p>Initially, a machine will have no officers onboarded. The first registration officer or supervisor will be on-boarded by an administrator. Thereafter this registration officer or supervisor can on-board other registration officers.
The system allows the following to occur for a successful on-boarding of a registration officer:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The system will on-board an officer using biometrics.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The quality threshold of  the biometrics is predefined.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The system will only allow to onboard an active registration officer.</p></li>
<li><p>Onboarding is allowed only when the machine is online.</p></li>
<li><p>The system will not allow to onboard a blacklisted officer/supervisor.</p></li>
<li><p>An onboarded officer/supervisor will be able to take the machine offline and login to use the machine in offline mode.</p></li>
<li><p>The system allows to onboard a multiple officers to the machine within the same center.</p></li>
<li><p>The system does not allow onboarding officers/supervisors who belong to different center.</p></li>
<li><p>Multiple officers can be onboarded but only one supervisor would be allowed to onboard.</p></li>

<p>MOSIP supports single factor and multi factor login including iris, fingerprint, and face capture. An admin configuration setting determines the mode of login.</p>

<p>If the Registration Client is offline, then system allows the supervisor to log in the client machine only with a password-based login. Whereas, if the Registration Client is online, the supervisor can log in to the client machine with all various type of login such as Password-based login, OTP based login, etc.</p>
<p>When a supervisor opts to log in the client machine, the system displays the appropriate options as per the mode of login.</p>
<ul class="simple">

<p><strong>(ii) OTP based login</strong></p>

<li><p>Alternatively, if the registration officer has remained inactive for a configured duration, he/she will be automatically logged out.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Inactive/idle time is defined as the time during which the registration officer has not submitted or retrieved data using the client application or navigated to a different page.</p></li>
<li><p>Any such action when performed resets the time to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The auto log out duration is configured by admin. The default value can be taken as 15 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Alerts the registration officer âxâ minutes before reaching the auto logout time limit. The system displays a countdown timer in the alert. The registration officer can choose to dismiss the alert and continue working. This will also reset the timer to zero.</p></li>
<li><p>The duration before which to display the alert is configured by admin. The default value can be taken as 2 minutes. That is, if auto logout time is 15 minutes then an alert will display after 13 minutes.</p></li>

<p>The UIN update feature is configurable by a country. Admin can turn either ON or OFF the UIN update feature.</p>
<p>When an individual approaches the registration officer for UIN update, the following scenarios may arise:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>If UIN update is turned ON by a country, the registration officer can proceed to capture the individualâs updated details.</p></li>

<p>System captures and stores details of each transaction during registration process for audit purpose (except PII data). The audit data is stored in the audit database.

<h1>9. Data Security <a class="reference external" href="#table-of-contents"><strong>[â]</strong></a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-security" title="Permalink to this headline">Â¶</a></h1>
<p>Registration Client integrates with Trusted Platform Model (TPM) data integrity. For enhanced security and integrity purposes, data captured from individuals are saved securely in local system and then shared to server. The details saved locally will be encrypted. Database encryption is also mandatory.</p>
<p>MOSIP performs the following:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Signing the data (This process is called as Signature) using Private Key provided by the TPM</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This process will ensure that the request to the server has been dispatched from a registered or trusted Registration Client machine</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Validates the signature against the actual data using the Public Key or Public Part. The application does not connect or access the underlying TPM to validate the Signature. This validation ensures that the request is from a registered or trusted Registration Client machine</p></li>
<li><p>Encrypts and decrypts the data using RSA algorithm in TPM. <a class="reference internal" href="Registration-Client.html"><span class="doc">Please refer to Wiki for more details on TPM</span></a>.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>System security and tampering of packets</strong></p>
<p>The system uses a machine and centre specific public key to encrypt. Only the server which has the respective private key, machine id and centre id can decrypt the encrypted packet. The data stored in database and application binaries are encrypted using TPM public key and registration officers will not be able to access directly.</p>
