<p>This document provides the detail of VDM technical specification to be adhere by the vendor to adopt their devices to the MOSIP platform
to capture the biometric data and manipulate on the same.</p>
<p><img alt="VDM Spec view" src="_images/vdm-spec-design.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Following points has been considered while designing the VDM spec:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Vendor should follow this MOSIP specification standards and provide the device along with the VDM service to integrate from application.</p></li>
<li><p>Any changes in the device state should notify the application.</p></li>
<li><p>VDM upgrade or new vendor devices added shouldn't impact the application code.</p></li>
<li><p>VDM should be provided along with the GUI to register and manage the running devices port .</p></li>
<li><p>Any security related to the device can be implemented at single stage rather doing at application end.</p></li>
<li><p>VDM should have capabilities to integrate with multiple devices like : Finger Print, IRIS and Face Reader.</p></li>
<li><p>No vendor specific code will be written inside the application.</p></li>
<li><p>All communication should happen through TCP/IP sockets to isolate the application from devices.</p></li>
<li><p>The software from each vendor will be executed as separate process and that won't impact the application.</p></li>
<li><p>VDM should be accessible from different platform and environment (Java, .Net).</p></li>
<li><p>The communication between the services should happen by exchanging XML messages.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>VDM - The Vendor Device Manager, provided by the device vendor, which manages the device,
and allows for biometric data capture.</p></li>
<li><p>DM  - The vendor independent Device Manager, which orchestrates the discovery, of the VDMs by the application,
and manages connectivity to the VDM.</p></li>
<li><p>Application - The Application that needs to use the biometric devices for capture.</p></li>

<p>The <strong>vendor must provide this</strong> as installer (and Uninstaller) to install and configure the VDM specific
to the requirement. During initial setup the required configuration to be completed using the respective GUI.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The DM port should be configured during initial setup of VDM.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the VDM has been started then communicate with the DM through TCP socket and port

<li><p>If VDM success to connect then continue with the Device Arrival api.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The communication with the VDM happens through the TCP socket and port from application.
The VDM should listen to a particular port to send and receive the command from application.
There is a separate socket should be opened to receive the Video streams and Biometric samples.</p>
<p>It provides following functionality, which will be triggered from the application based on the user actions.</p>

<p><strong>VDM process</strong></p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>VDM senses that a device under it's control is connected to the system.</p></li>
<li><p>VDM creates a Device Arrival / Removal event and sends it to the DM through socket and port.</p></li>

<h2>2. Device Manager - DM<a class="headerlink" href="#device-manager-dm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The <strong>DM provided by MOSIP</strong> is responsible for managing the list of all connected applications, VDMs, and
devices. Whenever a device arrives, it must register with the DM, and continue to send
a heartbeat event at regular intervals. Failure to send the heartbeat is treated as a
removal event. The DM sends a list of all connected devices to the application after the
initial connection, by forwarding stored Arrival events.</p>
<p>Multiple devices can be communicate with the DM and register with the respective available port for communication.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The DM service should Listen on a particular range of port to receive the device arrival and removal events from the VDM.</p></li>
<li><p>In case the provided ports are busy or occupied by some other service then should provide facility for an admin to modify the same.</p></li>
<li><p>It Maintain the list of the all the supported biometric devices available for the applications.</p></li>
<li><p>It also Notify the applications about arrival and removal of the supported devices (Plug and Play - PNP).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The DM service will be provided by the MOSIP. The DM responds to the following requests:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Connect        - VDM and application uses this api to initiate communication with DM.</p></li>
<li><p>Device Arrival - VDM uses this api to inform the DM whenever the PNP device connected.</p></li>
<li><p>Device Removal - VDM uses this api to inform the DM whenever the PNP device disconnected.</p></li>
<li><p>Ping           - This is used as a heartbeat event, to notify the DM that a VDM, is still alive.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The DM provides applications with the following events.</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Device Arrival</p></li>
<li><p>Device Removal</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The DM listens on a TCP/IP port (specified later in this document). Applications and the
VDMs must connect to this port once, and communicate over this open connection.</p>

<h2>3. Application<a class="headerlink" href="#application" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When the application needs to work with the device, it opens the socket to the location
pointed by the deviceURI in the Arrival event from the Device Manager. Only one application can open the device. The
device should reject the connections on the deviceURI, until the socket is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Application communicate with a particular device through the following URI.</strong><br />deviceURI =&quot;localhost:1234&quot;<br />videoURI  =&quot;localhost:1235&quot;<br />sampleURI =&quot;localhost:1236&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Bio-Metric Capture Sequence:</strong></p>
<p>The biometric data captured cane be done in 2 ways. Auto capture and Force Capture .</p>
<p><strong>Auto Capture :</strong></p>
<p>The Application subscribes to various events from the device, which allow it to provide
a useful interface to the user. The application then sends a <strong>StartCapture</strong> event to the
device, which provides a video stream, and subscribes the application to the
CaptureComplete event.
The application is expected (not required) to consume the video stream one frame at a
time by sending GetFrame requests. Multiple GetFrame requests can be queued, and
the device will respond to each request with a frame. Once capture is completed, the
device sends a capture complete message to the application. The application must then
use a GetSample request to get the biometric sample.</p>
<p><strong>Force Capture :</strong><br />If the device supports forced capture, the application may send a ForceCapture event to
the device. The device must respond with a CaptureComplete event. Following this, the
application must get the sample through a GetSample request.</p>
<p><img alt="Bio Capture Sequence process" src="_images/vdm-spec-device-capture-sequence.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="api-methods">
<h2>5. API Methods<a class="headerlink" href="#api-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There will be two types of API methods: commands and notification events. The
command API methods are initiated by the Application, while the event API methods are
initiated by the Biometric Capture Device.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>This specifies the request and response messages that are exchanged between
the Application, DM and VDM. All messages are in XML.</p></li>
<li><p>All requests and responses carry a requestId, which is a numeric value (128 bit),
represented as a 36 character UUID format string in XML. Since the API is asynchronous,
the requestId is used to connect requests with the appropriate response.</p></li>
<li><p>The VDM, DM and Application must not use requestId outside the scope of a request,
since this could be recycled.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Video stream from the Biometric Capture Device will be delivered using the binary
protocol over a separate channel. The final captured biometric samples will also be
delivered using the binary protocol through a separate channel. The request and
response messages for both video stream and biometric samples will be encoded using
ASN1 BER. See <a class="reference external" href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asn1"><strong>link</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>API Version Number :</strong></p>
<p>The version number for the current API is 1.0. The version number is included in every
API message.</p>
<p><strong>Connect :</strong>
On establishing connection with the DM, the application, and VDMs must ensure that
they are connecting with a DM, and exchange certain configuration information.</p>

<p><strong>Expected behaviour:</strong> change the list of subscribed events to the list in this command
request. The events to which the device was previously subscribed can be sent by the
RC1 MOSIP Biometric Capture Device API device until the response is sent. Any new events can only be fired after the response is
sent. If the command is subscribing for the notification to the change of state the
response should include the corresponding state at a time of response.
The following EventCategories are supported.</p>

<p>Usage example: the application needs to capture one finger, followed by the other. The
application issues capture request, which completes. The now application needs to wait
for the finger removed event before issuing the next capture request, to make sure that
the same finger is not captured again immediately.</p>

<p>The Video Stream will be retrieved using the binary protocol for sending video frames
(with the actual image data represented in ISO 19794-x) over the socket referenced by
videoURI using the pull model. The application will maintain pending Get Frame
requests for all the time that it can keep-up with the visualization.
The sample will be retrieved over the socket referenced by sampleURI, with the actual
image data represented in ISO 19794-x.
The requests and the responses are represented in ASN1 BER encoding. The rationale
in choosing BER encoding is to transfer the binary data in the self-descriptive extensible
data format with the reasonably low overhead.</p>

<p>The MOSIP platform should have ability to validate that the data received at the client application is
indeed the same data captured by the device. The device should be able to sign the data using specific key
before transmitting to the client. The same data should be validated at application end using another key.
If not valid then it will be rejected. However this is not currently mandatory. It will be implemented by
the MOSIP at later.</p>
<p>Whenever the security feature is implemented, the required changes will be taken care at API end.</p>
