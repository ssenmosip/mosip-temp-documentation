* **UIN Generation** _(UIG_FR_1)_

MOSIP generates a pool of UINs before the registration process and stores them. 
The UIN generation policies can be defined\modified by country as per their requirement


The UINs generated follow the following policies:


1. UIN should not contain any alphanumeric characters
1. UIN should not contain any repeating numbers for 2 or more than 2 digits
1. UIN should not contain any sequential number for 3 or more than 3 digits
1. UIN should not be generated sequentially
1. UIN should not have repeated block of numbers for 2 or more than 2 digits
1. The last digit in the number should be reserved for a checksum
1. The number should not contain '0' or '1' as the first digit.
1. First 5 digits should be different from the last 5 digits (E.g. 4345643456)
1. First 5 digits should be different to the last 5 digits reversed (E.g. 4345665434)
1. UIN should not be a cyclic figure 
1. UIN should be different from the repetition of the first two digits 5 times (E.g. 3434343434)
1. UIN should not contain three even adjacent digits (E.g. 3948613752)
1. UIN should not contain admin defined restricted number.

Note:
The number of UINs to be generated in a pool depends on a configuration to be done by the country depending on the peak registration requirements. UIN generation service will receive a request by Registration Processor to get a UIN. The service responds with an un-allocated UIN from the generated pool. 
When the pool reaches a configured number of minimum UINs, MOSIP generates another pool of UIN.
